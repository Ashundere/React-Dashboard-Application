## Reflection

I implemented React and Typescript features through the use of interfaces and prop handling. I struggled a lot with understanding prop drilling at first, but I got the hang of it as I continued working. I struggled to finish the amount of asks within the allotted time because I ended up having to do a lot of research and trial and error into getting form validation and the search bar to work. I also ended up having an error that would freeze my application anytime I tried to create a new task, but I figured out it was a bug regarding my dark mode filter that was causing the hang up. I fixed it quickly after figuring out the source. I approached component composition by creating interfaces of props that I guessed I would need to get the core functionality working. Then I built components around it. As I worked on state management, I came to realize I needed a lot more props than I had originally anticipated, and updated the components from there. I put most of my state management on the app itself, and had very little state management in the individual  components.
